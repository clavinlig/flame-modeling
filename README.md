## First of all

This is just a project for my bachelor diploma. We are working with MacKenna Burner.

I focuse on simulating combustion processes using the Cantera library and processing simulation output data. It includes modules for flame simulations, mechanism and data preprocessing. The project is structured to handle both computational modeling and data analysis tasks efficiently.

## Features

1. **Flame Simulation**:
   - Simulates stabilized flames using Cantera.
   - Customizable parameters such as fuel composition, flow rates, temperature, pressure, etc.
   - Saves simulation results (velocity, temperature, mole fractions) in CSV files.
   - Maintains a detailed log of all calculations.

2. **Mechanism**:
   - This is a code from developers.
   - Converts chemical reaction mechanisms between different formats (e.g., CK2YAML).

4. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Processes simulation output files to extract and aggregate relevant data.
   - Supports custom column selection and summation operations.
