## First of all

This is just a project for my bachelor diploma. We are working with MacKenna Burner.

I focuse on simulating combustion processes using the Cantera library and processing simulation output data. It includes modules for flame simulations, mechanism and data preprocessing.

## Features

1. **Flame Simulation**:
   - Simulates stabilized flames using Cantera.
   - Customizable parameters such as fuel composition, flow rates, temperature, pressure, etc.
   - Saves simulation results (velocity, temperature, mole fractions) in CSV files.
   - Maintains a detailed log of calculations.

2. **Mechanism**:
   - A code from developers.
   - Converts chemical reaction mechanisms from chemkin to yaml.

4. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Processes simulation output files to extract and aggregate relevant data.
